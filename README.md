# riot-xbee
Node Red XBee node for interaction with IOT devices over a mesh network.

This project provides the following nodes:

* Digital IO Change Detector - configure a digital input pin with Digital IO Change Detection mask and this node will receive state change tranmissions.
* Digital IO Output - drive a digital pin high or low
* Analog Input - configure an IO Sampling Rate for your XBee; this node will receive the value transmissions.
