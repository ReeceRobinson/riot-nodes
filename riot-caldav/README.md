# riot-caldav
## A collection of Node Red nodes for interaction with IOT devices over an XBee (ZigBee) mesh network.

This project provides the following node:

* CalDav Events - calendar integration to retrieve calendar events using the caldav protocol.
* CalDav Processor - processing of events that resolves event overlaps and emits 'commands' with event objects, based on calendar event content. 

**Note:** Server authentication is not currently supported.
## Usage

First, you will need to install the `riot-caldav` module (i.e.
`npm install riot-caldav`).
